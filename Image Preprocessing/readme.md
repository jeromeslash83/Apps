The Plant Disease Image Preprocessing App is a simple GUI application that allows users to apply various image preprocessing techniques on plant images, specifically for rice diseases. The app provides a user-friendly interface to select input and output folders, choose preprocessing techniques, and enter custom parameters for each technique.


Features
Select input and output folders for processing multiple images
Apply multiple preprocessing techniques, such as:
Resizing
Grayscale conversion
Histogram equalization
Gaussian blur
Customize preprocessing parameters for better results
How to Use
Download the standalone executable for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the releases page.

Launch the app by double-clicking the executable.

Click the "Browse Input Folder" button to select the folder containing the images you want to preprocess.
